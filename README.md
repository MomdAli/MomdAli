**About Me** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at HTWG Konstanz, passionate about Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and all things 3D programming. My technical strengths include building complex systems from scratchâ€”Iâ€™ve developed a ray tracer and a custom game engine, both of which showcase my problem-solving skills and my deep interest in graphics programming.

Outside of academics and coding, I enjoy staying active by going to the gym. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on innovative projects.
